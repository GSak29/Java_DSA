In a binary tree:

- Searching:      Time Complexity = O(n)
- Deletion:       Time Complexity = O(n)
- Insertion:      Time Complexity = O(n)

Types of Binary Tree

- Full Binary Tree        === if the parent nodes have 0 or 2 nodes they are called as full binary tree
- Complete Binary Tree    === fulling from left to right
- Perfect binary Tree     === exact 2 childs and same level
- Balanced Binary Tree    === Aka AVL tree
